# Project: Smashing Magazine Article Clone
A design teardown project from [the Odin Project Ruby on Rails course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown) focused on breaking down visual hierarchy and typography. The page is a greyscale heat map of the [Smashing Magazine Homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/). 

## Features 
Areas with the most visual weight are marked in a dark grey, with lesser weighted elements displayed in lighter greys.
Positioning and layout is based on a screen with a 1440x900 viewing window.
